	<h1>Hello, world</h1>
	<h2>My name is Heather.</h2>
	<p>Once upon a time I was on a fast track to becoming a web designer. 
		Then I got a job in communications. That is fun, but this is funner so I'm back on track.
		I like walks on the beach and baby unicorns.</p>
	<p>For awhile I used TextWrangler but this semester I'm trying Sublime.</p>
